I am creating software engineering videos on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/NetMentor). I do specialize in .NET specially C# and Blazor.

All the code for my videos can be found in my github repos, but you can find the full explanation of the implementation on my [Website](https://www.netmentor.es).
